There are many Expectations available for you to use.  To demonstrate creating an Expectation through the use of the Validator we defined earlier, here are examples of the process for two of them:

```python file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/deployment_patterns/databricks_deployment_patterns_file_yaml_configs.py#L164
```

```python file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/deployment_patterns/databricks_deployment_patterns_file_yaml_configs.py#L166-L168
```

Each time you evaluate an Expectation (e.g. via `validator.expect_*`) two things will happen.  First, the Expectation will immediately be Validated against your provided Batch of data. This instant feedback helps to zero in on unexpected data very quickly, taking a lot of the guesswork out of data exploration. Second, the Expectation configuration will be stored in the Expectation Suite you provided when the Validator was initialized.

This is the same method of interactive Expectation Suite editing used in the CLI interactive mode notebook accessed via `great_expectations suite new --interactive`. For more information, see our documentation on [How to create and edit Expectations with instant feedback from a sample Batch of data](../../../guides/expectations/how_to_create_and_edit_expectations_with_instant_feedback_from_a_sample_batch_of_data.md).

You can also create Expectation Suites using a [Data Assistant](../../../guides/expectations/data_assistants/how_to_create_an_expectation_suite_with_the_onboarding_data_assistant.md) to automatically create expectations based on your data or [manually using domain knowledge and without inspecting data directly](../../../guides/expectations/how_to_create_and_edit_expectations_based_on_domain_knowledge_without_inspecting_data_directly.md).
