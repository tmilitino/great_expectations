When we tested our Datasource in step [2.5: Test your new Datasource](../how_to_use_gx_with_aws_using_cloud_storage_and_pandas.md#25-test-your-new-datasource) we also created all of the components we need to begin creating Expectations: A Batch Request to provide sample data we can test our new Expectations against, an empty Expectation Suite to contain our new Expectations, and a Validator to create those Expectations with.

We can reuse those components now.  Alternatively, you may follow the same process that we did before and define a new Batch Request, Expectation Suite, and Validator if you wish to use a different Batch of data as the reference sample when you are creating Expectations or if you wish to use a different name than `test_suite` for your Expectation Suite.
