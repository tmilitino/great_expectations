title: How to create Expectations that span multiple Batches using Evaluation Parameters
---

import Prerequisites from '../../../guides/connecting_to_your_data/components/prerequisites.jsx';
import TechnicalTag from '@site/docs/term_tags/_tag.mdx';

This guide will help you create <TechnicalTag tag="expectation" text="Expectations" /> that span multiple <TechnicalTag tag="batch" text="Batches" /> of data using <TechnicalTag tag="evaluation_parameter" text="Evaluation Parameters" /> (see also <TechnicalTag tag="evaluation_parameter_store" text="Evaluation Parameter Stores" />). This pattern is useful for things like verifying that row counts between tables stay consistent.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a <TechnicalTag tag="data_context" text="Data Context" />.
- Configured a <TechnicalTag tag="datasource" text="Datasource" /> (or several Datasources) with at least two <TechnicalTag tag="data_asset" text="Data Assets" /> and understand the basics of <TechnicalTag tag="batch_request" text="Batch Requests" />.
- Also created <TechnicalTag tag="expectation_suite" text="Expectations Suites" /> for those Data Assets.
- Have a working Evaluation Parameter store. (The default in-memory <TechnicalTag tag="store" text="Store" /> from ``great_expectations init`` can work for this.)
- Have a working <TechnicalTag tag="checkpoint" text="Checkpoint" />

</Prerequisites>

## Steps

In a notebook,

### 1. Import great_expectations and instantiate your Data Context

```python
import great_expectations as gx
context = gx.get_context()
```

### 2. Instantiate two Validators, one for each Data Asset

We'll call one of these <TechnicalTag tag="validator" text="Validators" /> the *upstream* Validator and the other the *downstream* Validator. Evaluation Parameters will allow us to use <TechnicalTag tag="validation_result" text="Validation Results" /> from the upstream Validator as parameters passed into Expectations on the downstream.

It's common (but not required) for both Batch Requests to have the same Datasource and <TechnicalTag tag="data_connector" text="Data Connector" />.

 ```python
batch_request_1 = BatchRequest(
  datasource_name="my_datasource",
  data_connector_name="my_data_connector",
  data_asset_name="my_data_asset_1"
)
upstream_validator = context.get_validator(batch_request=batch_request_1, expectation_suite_name="my_expectation_suite_1")

batch_request_2 = BatchRequest(
  datasource_name="my_datasource",
  data_connector_name="my_data_connector",
  data_asset_name="my_data_asset_2"
)
downstream_validator = context.get_validator(batch_request=batch_request_2, expectation_suite_name="my_expectation_suite_2")
```

### 3. Disable interactive evaluation for the downstream Validator

```python
downstream_validator.interactive_evaluation = False
```

Disabling interactive evaluation allows you to declare an Expectation even when it cannot be evaluated immediately.

### 4. Define an Expectation using an Evaluation Parameter on the downstream Validator

```python
eval_param_urn = 'urn:great_expectations:validations:my_expectation_suite_1:expect_table_row_count_to_be_between.result.observed_value'
downstream_validator.expect_table_row_count_to_equal(
   value={
      '$PARAMETER': eval_param_urn, # this is the actual parameter we're going to use in the validation
   }
)
```

The core of this is a ``$PARAMETER : URN`` pair. When Great Expectations encounters a ``$PARAMETER`` flag during <TechnicalTag tag="validation" text="Validation" />, it will replace the ``URN`` with a value retrieved from an Evaluation Parameter Store or <TechnicalTag tag="metric_store" text="Metrics Store" /> (see also [How to configure a MetricsStore](../../../guides/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_a_metricsstore.md)).

This declaration above includes two ``$PARAMETERS``. The first is the real parameter that will be used after the Expectation Suite is stored and deployed in a Validation Operator. The second parameter supports immediate evaluation in the notebook.

When executed in the notebook, this Expectation will generate a Validation Result. Most values will be missing, since interactive evaluation was disabled.

```python
{
   "result": {},
   "success": null,
   "meta": {},
   "exception_info": {
      "raised_exception": false,
      "exception_traceback": null,
      "exception_message": null
   }
}
 ```

:::warning

Your URN must be exactly correct in order to work in production. Unfortunately, successful execution at this stage does not guarantee that the URN is specified correctly and that the intended parameters will be available when executed later.

:::

### 5. Save your Expectation Suite

 ```python
 downstream_validator.save_expectation_suite(discard_failed_expectations=False)
 ```

This step is necessary because your ``$PARAMETER`` will only function properly when invoked within a Validation operation with multiple Validators. The simplest way to execute such an operation is through a :ref:`Validation Operator <reference__core_concepts__validation__validation_operator>`, and Validation Operators are configured to load Expectation Suites from <TechnicalTag tag="expectation_store" text="Expectation Stores" />, not memory.

### 6. Execute an existing Checkpoint

You can do this within your notebook by running ``context.run_checkpoint``.

```python
results = context.run_checkpoint(
  checkpoint_name="my_checkpoint"
)
```

### 7. Rebuild Data Docs and review results in docs

You can do this within your notebook by running:

```python
context.build_data_docs()
```

You can also execute from the command line with:

```bash
great_expectations docs build
```

Once your <TechnicalTag tag="data_docs" text="Data Docs" /> rebuild, open them in a browser and navigate to the page for the new Validation Result.

If your Evaluation Parameter was executed successfully, you'll see something like this:

If it encountered an error, you'll see something like this. The most common problem is a mis-specified URN name.
