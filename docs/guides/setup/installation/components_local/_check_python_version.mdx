### 1. Check Python version
-->

First, check the version of Python that you have installed.  As of this writing, Great Expectations supports versions 3.7 through 3.10 of Python.

You can check your version of Python by running:

```console title="Terminal command"
python --version
```

If this command returns something other than a Python 3 version number (like Python 3.X.X), you may need to try this:

```console title="Terminal command"
python3 --version
```
